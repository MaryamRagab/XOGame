# XO Game

A simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This web application allows two players to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe on their browsers. Players take turns placing their markers (X and O) on the 3x3 game board. The first player to form a line of their markers (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells on the board are filled and no player has formed a line, the game ends in a draw.
